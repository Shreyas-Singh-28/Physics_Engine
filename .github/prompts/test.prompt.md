# Base Instructions
- Create the full website, don't stop unitl its done! Don't ask for my feedback, don't ask whether to continue.
- Create it in this current folder. 

# Feature
- Create a homepage with two html pages and minimalistic, simplistic ui. Use html, css, and javascript for the entire project.
- The project is a Physics Engine that illustrates different applications of physics.
- First page should be labeled Collision, second should be Gravity, and have thumbnails accordingly.
- For the first page, make a canvas with walls. Allow the user to add a ball with radius, x-y coordinate, and mass specifications. Then allow the user to control any ball using keys by clicking on that ball. Then showcase collisions when balls collide.
- For the second page labeled Gravity, create a canvas where users can add celestial bodies with mass, radius, and initial velocity. Simulate gravitational attraction between the bodies using Newton's law of gravitation. Allow users to toggle trails for the bodies to visualize their paths.
- Add a settings panel on both pages to adjust simulation parameters such as time step, gravity constant, and collision elasticity.
- Include a reset button on both pages to clear the canvas and reset the simulation.
- Provide a help modal that explains how to use the simulation, including controls and physics concepts being demonstrated.
- Add a toggle for dark mode and light mode for better user experience.
- Include a feature to save and load predefined scenarios, such as "Solar System" for the Gravity page or "Billiards" for the Collision page.
- Add basic sound effects for collisions and interactions, with an option to mute them.
